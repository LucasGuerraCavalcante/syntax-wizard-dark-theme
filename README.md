## Background 

This is a very personal small project. 

Since I've never found a theme that was completely visually pleasing to me, I was determined to try to find some balance by editing a theme that already existed.

My problem with some themes is my dislike for some specific colors (which is completely subjective). I particularly hate yellow and orange, which are unfortunately very common for representing strings. I don't like white either, I don't know why but it sometimes feels "out of context" to me. Also, I think that a dark theme should have a really dark background, something close to black feels more pleasing to me.

And I ðŸ’œ purple on dark backgrounds.

So guided by these subjective personal tastes that no one cares about, I started it...

## Inspirations 

I felt in love with the GitHub syntax highlight theme, especially the dark one. So I've decided to edit GitHub's VS Code theme, available here [github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme).

About the name... Well, it now has a lot of purple, which sometimes is related to magic and wizards, especially in video games and pop culture. It also reminds me of Electric Wizard, a heavy metal band that often uses purple in their artworks. So I came up with the Syntax Wizard ðŸ§™ðŸ”® . If there is a Dracula, I not a Wizard?! ðŸ˜„

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your color theme extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file and specifies the base theme of the theme.
* `themes/LucasGuerraCavalcante-color-theme.json` - the color theme definition file.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.
* Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Inspect TM Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) .

## Make changes

* Changes to the theme file are automatically applied to the Extension Development Host window.

## Adopt your theme to Visual Studio Code

* The token colorization is done based on standard TextMate themes. Colors are matched against one or more scopes.

To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation.

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.

## Make your on VS Code theme
